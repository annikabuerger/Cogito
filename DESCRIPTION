Description: Biological studies often consist of multiple conditions 
    which are examined with different laboratory set ups like RNA-sequencing or 
    ChIP-sequencing. To get an overview about the whole resulting data set, 
    Cogito provides an automated, complete, reproducible and clear report about 
    all samples and basic comparisons between all different samples. This report
    can be used as documentation about the data set or as starting point for 
    further custom analysis.
